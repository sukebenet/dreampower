def color_transfer(source, target, clip=True, preserve_paper=True):
    """
    Transfers the color distribution from the source to the target
    image using the mean and standard deviations of the L*a*b*
    color space.

    This implementation is (loosely) based on to the "Color Transfer
    between Images" paper by Reinhard et al., 2001.

    Parameters:
    -------
    source: NumPy array
        OpenCV image in BGR color space (the source image)
    target: NumPy array
        OpenCV image in BGR color space (the target image)
    clip: Should components of L*a*b* image be scaled by np.clip before
        converting back to BGR color space?
        If False then components will be min-max scaled appropriately.
        Clipping will keep target image brightness truer to the input.
        Scaling will adjust image brightness to avoid washed out portions
        in the resulting color transfer that can be caused by clipping.
    preserve_paper: Should color transfer strictly follow methodology
        layed out in original paper? The method does not always produce
        aesthetically pleasing results.
        If False then L*a*b* components will scaled using the reciprocal of
        the scaling factor proposed in the paper.  This method seems to produce
        more consistently aesthetically pleasing results

    -------
    transfer: NumPy array
